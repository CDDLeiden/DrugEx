## Fixes

- The `dataset` CLI script now captures test, train and unique sets in the right order for the fragment-based methods.
- Examples in the CLI tutorial were updated and fixed.
- The Linux command line script was fixed so that all arguments are passed correctly.
- The `train` and `generate` CLI scripts now have empty predictor (`-p, --predictor`) by default. This makes error messages less confusing.
